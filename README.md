# Empirical Project 1 - Applied Econometrics

This repository contains the code and data for an empirical project in **Applied Econometrics**. The analysis estimates treatment effects using various econometric techniques, including:

- Simple Mean Differences
- Probit and Random Forest Propensity Scores
- Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW)
- Doubly Robust (DR) Estimators
- Cross-Fitting for Bias Reduction
- 
The key objective is to demonstrate the advantages of Doubly Robust estimators and cross-fitting over traditional methods.
